Created whac-a-mole game in Javascript HTML CSS via Kenny Yip Coding Youtube.
Learned how to set game board by editing dom elements, add click handlers and ramdomly activate the Mole & Plant.
Especially, the new thing i've leaned is that how to prevent the images from being dragged and highlightened.
